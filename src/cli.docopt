The available commands are:

    list users      List all the users in a nice JSON array
    list tasks      List all the tasks for a user in a nice JSON array
    update task     This is the fundamental action, add/edit a task and run
                    and subsequent required workflow or actions. Reads stdin.
    *edit            Launches you $EDITOR, then updates when you quit, much like
                    editing a git commit message.

  *delete task
  accept <taskfile> by <username>
  reject <taskfile> by <username>
  *poke <username> about <taskfile>
